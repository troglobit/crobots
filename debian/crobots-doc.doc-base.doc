Title: The Robot Programmer's Guide for CROBOTS
Author: Tom Poindexter
Abstract: The comprehensive guide to programming CROBOTS.
 .
 Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling some
 object, all strategy in CROBOTS must be complete before the actual game
 begins.  Game strategy is condensed into a C language program that you
 design and write.  Your program controls a robot whose mission is to
 seek out, track, and destroy other robots, each running different
 programs.  Each robot is equally equipped, and up to four robots may
 compete at once.  CROBOTS is best played among several people, each
 refining their own robot program, then matching program against program.
 .
 CROBOTS consists of a C compiler, a virtual computer, and battlefield
 display (text graphics only, monochrome or color).  The CROBOTS compiler
 accepts a limited (but useful) subset of the C language.  The C robot
 programs are aided by hardware functions to scan for opponents, start
 and stop drive mechanisms, fire cannons, etc.  After the programs are
 compiled and loaded into separate robots, the battle is observed.
 Robots moving, missiles flying and exploding, and certain status
 information are displayed on the screen, in real-time.
