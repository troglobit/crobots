        CROBOTS ("see-robots") is a game based on computer programming.
        Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling
        some object, all strategy in CROBOTS must be complete before the
        actual game begins.  Game strategy is condensed into a C language
        program that you design and write.  Your program controls a robot
        whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots,
        each running different programs.  Each robot is equally equipped,
        and up to four robots may compete at once.  CROBOTS is best
        played among several people, each refining their own robot
        program, then matching program against program.

        CROBOTS consists of a C compiler, a virtual computer, and
        battlefield display (text graphics only, monochrome or color).
        The CROBOTS compiler accepts a limited (but useful) subset of
        the C language.  The C robot programs are aided by hardware
        functions to scan for opponents, start and stop drive mechanisms,
        fire cannons, etc.  After the programs are compiled and loaded
        into separate robots, the battle is observed.  Robots moving,
        missiles flying and exploding, and certain status information are
        displayed on the screen, in real-time.
